Here's a suggested README.md for your SMS classification project which uses a machine learning model to predict if a text is spam or not, with a Gradio interface for user interaction.


# SMS Spam Classification App

## Overview
This project provides a simple interface to classify SMS text messages as "spam" or "not spam". The classification is performed using a machine learning model built on a Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization. This solution allows users to interactively test SMS messages to determine if they are spam.

## Project Structure

- **sms_classification**: A Python function that constructs and trains a linear SVC model on SMS text data.
- **sms_prediction**: A Python function that predicts whether a given SMS text is spam.
- **Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly web interface to input SMS text and receive spam classification results.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Gradio

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script to start the Gradio app:
```bash
python gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb
```
3. Access the Gradio web interface through the link provided in your terminal.
4. Input an SMS text into the textbox and click "Submit" to see if it's spam or not.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a pre-existing SMS Spam Collection dataset which contains a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It includes one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according to being ham (legitimate) or spam.

## Features

- **SMS Classification**: Classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easy to use web interface for testing messages on-the-fly.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for better user experience.
